Final project from the additional education of data analysis
I had 3 tasks related to product analysis:
1)Your task is to write a function that will count the retention of players (by day from the date of registration of the player)
2)There are the results of an A/B test in which two groups of users were offered different sets of promotional offers. 
It is known that ARPU in the test group is higher by 5% than in the control group. 
At the same time in the control group 1928 out of 202103 players turned out to be paying, and in the test group 1805 out of 202667 players turned out to be paying.
Which set of sentences could be considered the best? What metrics should be analyzed to make the right decision, and how?
3)Plants & Gardens has a limited time themed event every month. In these, players can earn unique garden and character items, extra coins, or bonuses. 
To receive a reward, you must complete a series of levels in a certain amount of time. 
What metrics can I use to evaluate the results of the last event that took place?
