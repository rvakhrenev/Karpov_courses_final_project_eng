    "1)DAU, WAU, Stickness, and average session time during the event, compare to similar metrics for the week/week after the event\n",
    "2)Retention, also compare those who logged in to the event and the same period last week (or other period)\n",
    "3)ARPU, ARPPU. See with these metrics how much people donate while passing levels, probably some players will invest more money than usual to pass complex levels and get rewards for their passage\n",
